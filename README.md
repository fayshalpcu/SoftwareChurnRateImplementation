# SoftwareChurnRateImplementation
This is a first software mining project for programming test.

I will explain step by step how to run this project to IntelliJ IDEA in two different ways.

Option - 01: 

The first thinkg we need to do is to clone the repository to our local machine. 

To do this, please go to the GitHub repository and click on the code select HTTPS and copy the URL.

When we first open the IntelliJIEDA and we don't have any opened projects, we will see a welcome screen.

Then click on the option named "Get from VCS" or get a project from version control.

After clicking on this icon past the coppied URL in the empty URL box and press clone or enter.

IntelliJ will clone teh GitHub repository safely to the directory for use.

Option - 02: 

If we already have a project opened in IntelliJ IDEA, then follow the step bellow. 

Click on the "VCS" manue that exists  at the top icon of IntelliJ and select "Get from Version Control".

After clicking on "Get from the Version Control" same dialog will appeared with a empty URL box.

Past the GitHub coppied repository in that empty box and press enter or clone. 


*** After safely  importing the project from git repository to IntelliJ IDEA please add the following library to the project.

To add the library please click on the "File" icon and project structure.

When project structure is opened it will show a empty scrept, at the top there there will be a "+" plus icone.

Click on the plus icon and chose "From Maven" option. A empty box named "Download Library from Maven Repository" will be appeared.

In the empty box write "com.google.code.gson" and clic on the search button and chose the most lates version existing there.

After this, check the "Download to" and "Transitive Dependencies" boxes only and press "OK".

Once you press on the "OK" button the Json library will be ready to added with our project. 

Then please press the "apply" and "Ok" buttons simultaneously to add the library with our project.

Now, if you want to verify go to the main project there you will see a folder named "lib" that is the prof of successful addition of Json to the current project.


Finally, to run the project simply click on the run button the project will be compiled with necessary building and degugs.
